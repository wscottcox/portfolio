Subject: FM+SGML: promoting/demoting elements via the popup menu

For those times when you're working in FM+SGML and moving lots of elements
up or down in the structure, the following *new* menu items/macros may be 
quite time-saving. 

NB: You must add the macro and menu code included at the end of this
message to your ~/fminit/fmMacros file on presskit for these enhancements
to take effect. (This could be complicated by NIS, but we can easily fix
the problem--ask me if you have any questions.) Of course, you also have to
read the fmMacros file in--either on FM+SGML startup or by forcing it to be
read.

I call these menu items/macros because they are keyboard macros that can be
triggered by certain key sequences or by selecting menu items. 

The keyboard triggers are:

   SHIFT+F3 to promote an element higher in the structure

   SHIFT+F4 to demote an element

NB: If you already use the key sequences above for other tasks, be sure to
bind the macros to other keys. (Ask me if you have any questions.)

The menu items are located in the Pop Up menu. Access this menu by placing
your cursor in a FM+SGML and right-clicking (click and hold). I've placed
the items "Promote(down)" and "Demote(up)" after the "Unwrap" menu item.

Interestingly, in the Structure View, a promoted element is moved downward
to obtain its elevated status. Similarly, a demoted element is moved upward
to its lower status. I found this movement confusing, so I added the
reminders "(down)" and "(up)" to the menu items as noted in the previous
paragraph. 

Copy the code below the line into your ~/fminit/fmMacros file. Create the
~/fminit directory and the fmMacros file if the do not already exist. Keep
the code in the exact order shown here. As always, let me know if you have
any questions.
