Subject: Script for generating TOC for HTML file<br>

<p>I have a perl script that takes an HTML file and produces a copy of that
HTML file, but includes a TOC (table of contents) at the top of the copy. 

<p>Usage:<br>

<code>% gen.TOC.pl</code> <em>input.html</em> &gt <em>output.html</em>

<p>You maintain and update the <em>input.html</em> file. 
<br>Create the <em>output.html</em> file just for posting on the net. 

<p>The script is available on presskit at
<br>
<code>/usr/local/doctools/bin/gen.TOC.pl</code>

<p>I have a variation of gen.TOC.pl:
<br>
<code>/usr/local/doctools/bin/gen.TOC.numbered.pl</code>

<p>This script numbers the sections in the HTML file and includes those
section numbers in the TOC.

<p>Use this script the same as gen.TOC.pl.
